1) It will cost 56 units. Each push operation will cost one unit. Once it does 8 pushes, it will have to resize (resizing will cost one unit of time to perform) so it will cost double of the current size which is 8. This will keep happening until 32 pushes have occured. This happens to be after resizing twice. This operation is O(1)+. The plus sign indicates it is not a guaranteed execution time bound. 

2) It will cost 260 units of time. When it resizes by 2 spaces, it will take 1 unit of time to create 2 new spaces and then it will have to move each item into the new unit. This method takes a lot of time to do because it has to keep resizing so many time.s This operation is O(n).

3) The way we can get the performance to be O(N^2) is if we start with an push() then pop() twice then push() twice and keep repeating the push and pop methods twice over and over. If it contracts when it is half full, we wont have enough credits to allow the expansion and contractions alternating in the manner it is. The way to avoid this is to only allow expansions when it is half full and contractions at 1/4 full. This will prevent us from not having enough "credits", which will allow contractions to happen.
